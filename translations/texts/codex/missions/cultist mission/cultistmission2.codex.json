One inquisitive researcher has theorised that the ancients themselves were not organic beings, judging by trace metallic samples left on the doorway's carvings. \n\nThe automaton, however, has yielded more promising results. The liquid core within it is a volatile and potent source energy, and the automaton's remaining hand has been proven to have ballistic qualities. The liquid core can be used as a power source and also be emitted in a searing energy form - a discovery made at the inconvenient expense one of our engineers."
